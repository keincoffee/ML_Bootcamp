# Car Price Prediction with Linear Regression

This project aims to develop a regression model to predict the prices of cars using linear regression.

## Project Plan

### 1. Prepare Data and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
- The data will be collected and preprocessed. The EDA will involve analyzing the dataset and visualizing the relationships between the features and the target variable.

### 2. Use Linear Regression for Predicting Price: 
- Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In this project, we will use linear regression to predict car prices based on the features of the car.

### 3. Understanding the Internals of Linear Regression: 
- It is essential to understand how linear regression works to interpret the model's output and adjust the model's parameters.

### 4. Evaluating the Model with RMSE: 
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is a commonly used metric to evaluate regression models' performance. We will use RMSE to assess the accuracy of our linear regression model.

### 5. Feature Engineering: 
- Feature engineering is the process of selecting and transforming the input variables used in the model to improve the model's accuracy. We will explore different feature engineering techniques to improve our model.

### 6. Regularization: 
- Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the model. We will implement regularization techniques such as L1 and L2 regularization to improve our model's generalization performance.

### 7. Using the Model: 
- After building and evaluating the model, we will use it to predict car prices based on the input features.

## Tools and Libraries
